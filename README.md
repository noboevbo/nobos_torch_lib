# nobos torch lib

This repository contains code that I use in several of my projects. Included is among other things:

- Models for a human pose-based action recognition pipeline (see https://github.com/noboevbo/ehpi_action_recognition)
- Other models for detection, pose estimation, action recognition etc. which are used in multiple of my projects
- Dataset code 
- (Customized) imbalanced dataset sampler

The repository is publicly accessible, but it's mainly used for my private projects, so I can't guarantee a stable state. Changes to the code are possible at any time.

## Open Source Acknowledgments
I used parts of the following open source projects in my code:

- YoloV3: https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3
- 2D Human Pose Estimation: https://github.com/Microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch
- Imbalanced dataset sampler: https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler/

Thank you for making this code available!
